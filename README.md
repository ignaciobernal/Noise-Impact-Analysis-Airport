# Noise Impact Analysis – San Sebastián Airport  

## Overview  
This repository contains a **noise impact analysis** of **San Sebastián Airport (Spain)**, conducted using the **Integrated Noise Model (INM)** developed by the **FAA (Federal Aviation Administration)**. The study evaluates how aircraft noise levels affect nearby populations.  

## About the Integrated Noise Model (INM)  
The **INM** is a powerful yet **outdated** software for airport noise assessment. Despite its usefulness, it lacks modern documentation and tutorials online. This repository aims to assist those who need to use INM by providing a real-world case study.  

## Contents  
- **Noise Impact Analysis (PDF – Spanish)**: The main document containing the analysis.  
- Additional resources may be added in the future.  

## Language Notice  
The attached **PDF report is in Spanish**, but the methodology and findings may still be useful for researchers and airport noise analysts worldwide.
